# Learnable Triangulation of Human Pose
This repository is an official PyTorch implementation of the paper ["Learnable Triangulation of Human Pose"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05754) (ICCV 2019, oral). Here we tackle the problem of 3D human pose estimation from multiple cameras. We present 2 novel methods — Algebraic and Volumetric learnable triangulation — that **outperform** previous state of the art.

# How to use
This project doesn't have any special or difficult-to-install dependencies. All installation can be down with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
*Note:* only [Human3.6M](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/description.php) dataset training/evaluation is available right now. [CMU Panoptic](http://domedb.perception.cs.cmu.edu/) dataset will be added soon.

#### Human3.6M
1. Download and preprocess the dataset by following the instructions in [mvn/datasets/human36m_preprocessing/README.md](https://github.com/karfly/learnable-triangulation-pytorch/blob/master/mvn/datasets/human36m_preprocessing/README.md).
2. Place the preprocessed dataset to `data/human36m`. If you don't want to store the dataset in the directory with code, just create a soft symbolic link: `ln -s {PATH_TO_HUMAN36M_DATASET}  ./data/human36m`.
3. Download pretrained backbone's weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TGHBfa9LsFPVS5CH6Qkcy5Jr2QsJdPEa) and place them here: `data/pretrained/human36m/pose_resnet_4.5_pixels_human36m.pth` (ResNet-152 trained on COCO dataset and finetuned jointly on MPII and Human3.6M).
4. If you want to train Volumetric model, you need rough estimations of the 3D skeleton both for train and val splits. You have two options:
 - Rough 3D skeletons can be estimated by Algebraic model and placed to `data/precalculated_results/human36m/results_train.pkl` and `data/precalculated_results/human36m/results_val.pkl` respectively.
 - Other option is to use the ground truth (GT) estimate of the 3D skeleton by setting `use_gt_pelvis: true` in a config file. Here you don't need any precalculated results, but such training mode overestimates the resulting accuracy, because pelvis is always perfectly defined.

#### CMU Panoptic
*Will be added soon*

## Train
Every experiment is defined by `.config` files. Configs with experiments from the paper can be found in `experiments` directory (results can be found below):

**Human3.6M:**
 1. Algebraic w/o confidences — [experiments/human36m/train/human36m_alg_no_conf.yaml](https://github.com/karfly/learnable-triangulation-pytorch/blob/master/experiments/human36m/train/human36m_alg_no_conf.yaml)
 2. Algebraic w/ confidences — [experiments/human36m/train/human36m_alg.yaml](https://github.com/karfly/learnable-triangulation-pytorch/blob/master/experiments/human36m/train/human36m_alg.yaml)
 3. Volumetric (softmax aggregation) — [experiments/human36m/train/human36m_vol_softmax.yaml](https://github.com/karfly/learnable-triangulation-pytorch/blob/master/experiments/human36m/train/human36m_vol_softmax.yaml)
 4. Volumetric (softmax aggregation, GT pelvis) — [experiments/human36m/train/human36m_vol_softmax_gtpelvis.yaml](https://github.com/karfly/learnable-triangulation-pytorch/blob/master/experiments/human36m/train/human36m_vol_softmax_gtpelvis.yaml)

 **CMU Panoptic**

 *Will be added soon*


#### Single-GPU
To train a Volumetric model with softmax aggregation and GT-estimated pelvises using **1 GPU**, run:
```bash
python3 train.py \
  --config experiments/human36m/train/human36m_vol_softmax_gtpelvis.yaml \
  --logdir ./logs
```

The training will start with the config file specified by `--config`, and logs (including tensorboard files) will be stored in `--logdir`.

#### Multi-GPU (*in testing*)
Multi-GPU training is implemented with PyTorch's [DistributedDataParallel](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#distributeddataparallel). It can be used both for single-machine and multi-machine (cluster) training. To run the processes use the PyTorch [launch utility](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/distributed/launch.py).

To train a Volumetric model with softmax aggregation and GT-estimated pelvises using **2 GPUs on single machine**, run:
```bash
python3 -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 --master_port=2345 \
  train.py  \
  --config experiments/human36m/train/human36m_vol_softmax_gtpelvis.yaml \
  --logdir ./logs
```

## Tensorboard
To watch your experiments' progress, run tensorboard:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir ./logs
```

## Evaluation
After training, you can evaluate the model. Inside the same config file, add path to the learned weights (they are dumped to `logs` dir during training):
```yaml
model:
    init_weights: true
    checkpoint: {PATH_TO_WEIGHTS}
```

Also, you can change other config parameters like `retain_every_n_frames_test`.

Run:
```bash
python3 train.py \
  --eval --eval_dataset val \
  --config experiments/human36m/eval/human36m_vol_softmax.yaml \
  --logdir ./logs
```
Argument `--eval_dataset` can be `val` or `train`. Results can be seen in `logs` directory or in the tensorboard.

# Results
* We conduct experiments on two available large multi-view datasets: Human3.6M [\[2\]](#references) and CMU Panoptic [\[3\]](#references).
* The main metric is **MPJPE** (Mean Per Joint Position Error) which is L2 distance averaged over all joints.

## Human3.6M
* We significantly improved upon the previous state of the art (error is measured relative to pelvis, without alignment).
* Our best model reaches **17.7 mm** error in absolute coordinates, which was unattainable before.
* Our Volumetric model is able to estimate 3D human pose using **any number of cameras**, even using **only 1 camera**. In single-view setup, we get results comparable to current state of the art [\[6\]](#references) (49.9 mm vs. 49.6 mm).

# Method overview
We present 2 novel methods of learnable triangulation: Algebraic and Volumetric.

## Algebraic
![algebraic-model](docs/algebraic-model.svg)

Our first method is based on Algebraic triangulation. It is similar to the previous approaches, but differs in 2 critical aspects:
1. It is **fully differentiable**. To achieve this, we use soft-argmax aggregation and triangulate keypoints via a differentiable SVD.
2. The neural network additionally predicts **scalar confidences for each joint**, passed to the triangulation module, which successfully deals with outliers and occluded joints.

For the most popular Human3.6M dataset, this method already dramatically reduces error by **2.2 times (!)**, compared to the previous art.


## Volumetric
![volumetric-model](docs/volumetric-model.svg)

In Volumetric triangulation model, intermediate 2D feature maps are densely unprojected to the volumetric cube and then processed with a 3D-convolutional neural network. Unprojection operation allows **dense aggregation from multiple views** and the 3D-convolutional neural network is able to model **implicit human pose prior**.

Volumetric triangulation additionally improves accuracy, drastically reducing the previous state-of-the-art error by **2.4 times!** Even compared to the best parallelly developed [method](https://github.com/microsoft/multiview-human-pose-estimation-pytorch) by MSRA group, our method still offers significantly lower error of **21 mm**.
